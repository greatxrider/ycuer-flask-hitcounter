This repository contains the practice code for the **Evaluating Vulnerability Analysis** lab in the Coursera.org course [**IBM-CD0267EN-SkillsNetwork Application Security and Monitoring**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/application-security-and-monitoring)

## Contents

This lab contains a Python Flask backend that uses an older version of Flask to demonstrate now vulnerabilities can be found in packages that once did not have vulnerabilities. 

It also demonstrates the use of **SonaType Nexus Community Jake** which is a community-created, open source tool that is designed to check Python environments for vulnerabilities. While Jake is not created by or supported by Sonatype, it uses the Sonatype OSS Index.
